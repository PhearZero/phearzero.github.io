Welcome to [@PhearZero](https://phearzero.com), the place where my "fun" projects go. Gaming, networking, and 
"extracurricular" activities. If your into something more professional see the [@NodeJunkie](https://nodejunkie.github.io)
 organization. If your looking for networking specifically, hop on over to [@PhearNet](https://phearnet.github.io). 
 Caution, there be dragons here!

# phearzero.github.io


This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) Theme, based on [jekyll-theme-hacker](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker), 
used in all of my personal [Github](https://github.com/phearzero) pages.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "phearzero.github.io"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: phearzero.github.io
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install phearzero.github.io

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on [GitHub]({{ site.github.issues_url }}). This project is 
intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the 
[Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your 
browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. 
like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site 
will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `phearzero.github.io.gemspec` accordingly.
